# Rock Paper Scissor
Rock paper scissor assignment, from The Odin Project curriculum.
The first version is simply played from the console, but apparently we will revisit it later.

Currently, it is played in the console by calling game(), and the only valide inputs are
rock, paper, and scissors.

The spelling is not case sensitive, but it is character sensitive.
If you input anything else, it will result in a draw.
